The -ci suffix denotes a person who works with something, in this case *tem√ºr, or iron. Modern Turkish‚Äôs ‚Äúdemirci‚Äù, also meaning ‚Äúblacksmith‚Äù, is a descendent of this word and a cognate to Temujin. These names and their friends were and are still common throughout the region. For example, Timur (also known as Tamerlame), of the Timurid Empire, shares the same root‚ÄîTimur, like Turkish demir, means iron."

Quite a few European languages seem to have picked this word up via contact with Central Asians. The most likely source appears to be Proto-Turkic, which makes sense given the role they played in Central Asian empires. But there‚Äôs another cognate to ordu that‚Äôs even more interesting: Urdu, the national language of Pakistan. The Mughal Empire of India established Persian as the official language of the empire, and the Hindustani dialect spoken in the military camps came to be referred to as ‚ÄúZaban-e-Urdu‚Äù in Persian, or ‚Äúlanguage of the army‚Äù, eventually being shortened to just ‚ÄúUrdu‚Äù."

    "text": "Rickshaw\nRickshaws are small, hand-drawn passenger carts that were (and in some places, are) popular in Asia. It comes from the Japanese word ‰∫∫ÂäõËªä jinrikisha. But when it entered the English language, it actually already had a cognate, a word that came from the same root: wheel.\nFive thousand years, a group called the Yamnaya used carts and wagons on the Ukrainian Steppe. This group is generally accepted to be the source of the Indo-European Languages‚Äîa language family encompassing languages as diverse as English, Persian, and Hindi. Their word for wheel was probably something like *k ∑√©k ∑los. This evolved over time to be something like *hwehwlƒÖ, in Proto-Germanic, the most recent common ancestor of languages like German, English, and Norwegian. This eventually became *hwe≈çl in Old English and wheel today. That was journey that the word *k ∑√©k ∑los took westward to arrive in English as wheel. But how did it arrive in Japanese as jinrikishaw?\nNot all of the Yamnaya people went west into Europe. Some went south into Iran and India, others went east to the edge of Mongolia. We call the earliest of these people the Afanasievo Culture, but we only know them through their archeological remains. One of the things we know about them, however, is that they used carts as early as ~3500 BCE. They are also likely to be the source of a group known as the Tocharians, that lived in the Tarim Basin in modern day Xinjiang, China. They spoke a family of languages known as Tocharian and were producing manuscripts in their languages as late as 500-800 AD. Between the Afanasievans and the Tocharians, there was almost certainly a continuous, cart-using Indo-European presence on the Chinese periphery for roughly 4000 years, a time period including the earliest known presence of wheeled vehicles in China.\nSome of these Indo-European speakers are likely the source of the Old Chinese word for wheeled vehicles, Ëªä, which would have been pronounced *k ∞lja around 1200 BC. This evolved into something like *tÕ°…ï ∞ia in Middle Chinese. That was borrowed into Japanese as ‰∫∫ÂäõËªä jinrikisha, or ‚Äúhuman-power cart‚Äù, recognizably the same word we use in English today and a cognate with ‚Äúwheel‚Äù."
