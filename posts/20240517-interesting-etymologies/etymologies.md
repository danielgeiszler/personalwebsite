This is a running list of etymologies that I think are neat. 

## Temujin
Genghis Khan was just a title; his real name was *Temujin*. Temujin is a Mongolic name that was probably borrowed from the Proto-Turkic [*\*temürči* ](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Temujin) meaning “blacksmith”. The -ci suffix denotes a person who works with something, in this case *\*temür*, or iron. Modern Turkish’s “demirci”, also meaning “blacksmith”, is a descendent of this word and a cognate to Temujin. These names and their friends were and are still common throughout the region. For example, Timur (also known as [Tamerlame](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur)), of the Timurid Empire, shares the same root—Timur, like Turkish demir, means iron.

## Ordu
Ordu is the Turkish word for “army”. It actually has an English cognate, “horde”! Quite a few European languages seem to have picked this word up via contact with Central Asians. The most likely [source](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/horde) appears to be Proto-Turkic, which makes sense given the role they played in Central Asian empires. But there’s another cognate to ordu that’s even more interesting: [Urdu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu), the national language of Pakistan. The [Mughal Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire) of India established Persian as the official language of the empire, and the Hindustani dialect spoken in the military camps came to be referred to as “_Zaban-e-Urdu_” in Persian, or “language of the army”, eventually being shortened to just “Urdu”.

## Rickshaw
Rickshaws are small, hand-drawn passenger carts that were (and in some places, are) popular in Asia. It comes from the Japanese word 人力車 _jinrikisha_. But when it entered the English language, it actually already had a cognate, a word that came from the same root: wheel. 

Five thousand years, a group called the [Yamnaya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamnaya_culture) used carts and wagons on the Ukrainian Steppe. This group is generally accepted to be the source of the [Indo-European Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages)—a language family encompassing languages as diverse as English, Persian, and Hindi. Their word for wheel was probably something like [*\*kʷékʷlos*](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/k%CA%B7%C3%A9k%CA%B7los). This evolved over time to be something like [*\*hwehwlą*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/hwehwl%C4%85), in [Proto-Germanic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Germanic_language), the most recent common ancestor of languages like German, English, and Norwegian. This eventually became *\*hweōl* in Old English and _wheel_ today. That was journey that the word *\*kʷékʷlos* took westward to arrive in English as *wheel*. But how did it arrive in Japanese as *jinrikishaw*?

Not all of the Yamnaya people went west into Europe. Some went south into Iran and India, others went east to the edge of Mongolia. We call the earliest of these people the [Afanasievo Culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afanasievo_culture), but we only know them through their archeological remains. One of the things we know about them, however, is that they used carts as early as ~3500 BCE. They are also likely [to be the source](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.cub.2019.06.044) of a group known as the Tocharians, that lived in the Tarim Basin in modern day Xinjiang, China. They spoke a family of languages known as [Tocharian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocharian_languages) and were producing manuscripts in their languages as late as 500-800 AD. Between the Afanasievans and the Tocharians, there was almost certainly a continuous, cart-using Indo-European presence on the Chinese periphery for roughly 4000 years, a time period including the [earliest known presence](https://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp099_wheeled_vehicles_china.pdf) of wheeled vehicles in China.

Some of these Indo-European speakers are likely the source of the [Old Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Chinese) word for wheeled vehicles, 車, which would have been pronounced *[\*kʰlja](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%BB%8A#Chinese)* around 1200 BC. This  evolved into something like *\*t͡ɕʰia* in [Middle Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Chinese). That was borrowed into Japanese as [人力車](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%BA%BA%E5%8A%9B%E8%BB%8A#Japanese "人力車") _jinrikisha_, or “human-power cart”, recognizably the same word we use in English today and a cognate with “wheel”.
