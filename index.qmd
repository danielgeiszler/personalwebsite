# Hi, I'm Danny ðŸ§¬

Iâ€™m a bioinformatician that develops computational tools for proteomics, especially to study post-translational modifications (PTMs), which I think are pretty neat. Right now, Iâ€™m at Istanbulâ€™s KoÃ§ University as an EMBO Postdoctoral Fellow working in the Ã–zlÃ¼ Lab, trying to figure out how to maximize the PTM information we can get out of DIA data using machine learning and Bayesian statistics.

#### Things I know about
* Bioinformatics
* Proteomics
* Post-translational modifications
* Mass spectrometry
* Molecular biology, biochemistry
* Statistics, probability, data science
* Python, Java
* English, Spanish, Turkish

Previously, I did my Bioinformatics PhD at the University of Michigan in Alexey Nesvizhskiiâ€™s lab, where I developed PTM-Shepherd and contributed to the upkeep of FragPipe, as well as helping in several PTM-related statistics and data science projects. In 2022, I moved to Turkey to start work in biomarker discovery as a Marie Curie-TÃœBÄ°TAK CoFund Fellow.

Outside the lab, you can find me drinking coffee and learning languages. If you're ever up for a friendly chat or potential collaboration, don't hesitate to reach out.
