#### Hi, I'm Danny ðŸ§¬

I'm an EMBO Postdoctoral Fellow at Istanbulâ€™s KoÃ§ University, trying to figure out how to maximize the PTM information we can get out of DIA data using machine learning and Bayesian statistics.

I did my Bioinformatics PhD at the University of Michigan in Alexey Nesvizhskiiâ€™s lab where I developed PTM-Shepherd and contributed to the upkeep of FragPipe, as well as helping in several PTM-related statistics and data science projects. In 2022, I moved to Turkey to start work in biomarker discovery as a Marie Curie-TÃœBÄ°TAK CoFund Fellow.

If you're ever up for a friendly chat or potential collaboration, don't hesitate to reach out.
